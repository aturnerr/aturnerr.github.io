          <h1>About me</h1>
          <div class="intro">
            <p id='bio'>I’m a passionate programmer and designer in my free time, I enjoy working on and learning about fields in both development and design, such as cybersecurity, games, UI/UX and web design to name a few.<br><br>
              I love the challenges faced at University and the friends I make along the way. Creating and discussing solutions for projects has taught me so much over the past 2 years of my course and I’m excited to bring those skills out into the workforce.<br><br>
              I’ve recently developed a love for travel and am also an amateur photographer, with a passion for capturing those special and memorable moments for myself and others.</p>

          <h2>Education<h2>
          <h3>University of Melbourne</h3>
          <h4>2017 - Present</h4>
          <p>I am currently in the third year of my undergraduate degree at Melbourne, and am part of the first cohort of students taking the new Bachelor of Design. I chose this degree as it contained pathway options for both of my interests in design and computing, which allowed me to mix my choice of electives and core subjects from both faculties. I’ll be completing the degree with a major in Computing and a minor in Digital Technologies.</p>
          <h3>Suzanne Cory High School</h3>
          <h4>2013 - 2016</h4>
          <p>In 2012 I was offered a place at Suzanne Cory, one of the four selective entry high schools in Victoria. Throughout my time there I was able to further develop my passion for computing and design in my electives and VCE which helped me to graduate with an ATAR capable of securing me a position in the Bachelor of Design.</p>
